# SDAD
Distance-based anomaly detection of urban traffic data.

This repository contains the code for SDAD (Spatiotemporal Distance-based Anomaly Detection) method for urban traffic flow (count) data.

## Requirements
Implementation is done with Python 3.12.4 . 
All the required libraries with their specific versions are mentioned here:

```
pip install numpy == 1.26.4
pip install pandas == 2.2.2
pip install scikit-learn == 1.5.0
```

## Implementation
To run SDAD, this reporsitory needs to be cloned into a local machine. 

Then [AnoLT](https://github.com/imaantaheri/AnoLT) data should be also dowloaded and copied into the `data` folder.
